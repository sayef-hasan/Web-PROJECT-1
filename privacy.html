This policy describes:<br>

The types of information we may collect from you or that you may provide when you visit the website www.tailwindapp.com (our "Website" ), when you purchase, download, install, register with, access, or use the TAILWIND APP (the "App" ), or when you use one of Services including Tailwind, Tailwind Plus, Tailwind Lite, Tailwind Pro, and the Enterprise Platform and other services made available (the "Platforms").

Personal Information We Collect and How We Collect It
Personal information is information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. An identifiable natural person is an individual that can be identified, directly or indirectly, be referenced to an identifier such as: a name, an identification number, specific location data, an online identifier, or other attributes specific to that natural person.
